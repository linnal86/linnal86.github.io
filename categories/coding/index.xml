      <description>Configure token authentication for git operations through GitHub GitHub has announced token authentication requirements for git operations . They will not support password authentication for git operations and will require using personal access tokens over HTTPS or SSH keys by August 13, 2021.
The recommendation is to use personal access tokens and it is explained in this youtube video about personal access tokens .
Setting up personal access tokens You can generate the personal access token in GitHub by going into &amp;gt;Settings &amp;gt;Developer settings &amp;gt;Personal access tokens</description>

      <description>Athena flights I worked on this project with @Joseph Tran . This is a web app built with Next.js, React and Typescript on the front-end. We used Postgres for the database and Typeorm with Apollo Server and Graphql on the back-end. We queried SpaceX&amp;rsquo;s api, then added flight information to the launches so users can choose flights to book based on destination and departure dates. I worked on both the front-end and back-end functionality to filter flights, authenticate users, cancel bookings.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on getting this hugo blog up and running. I want to have a place where I can share my thoughts on projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping a google doc journal for myself but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s a hassle to have to go online to write it. I was thinking about moving my journal to markdown anyways so I might as well just host it online with hugo as well.</description>

      <description>It took me 2 weeks to figure out how to deploy my fullstack nodejs react app. It uses the MERN stack - mongodb, express, react, and nodejs. I watched multiple youtube videos and read various blogs. I had to reference numerous different sources so here is a consolidated guide of how to do it.
Digital Ocean Setup I hosted my server on digitalocean. The alternatives includes Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Siteground, Heroku, etc but I found that digitalocean was the easiest, most reliable and the cheapest in the long run.</description>
