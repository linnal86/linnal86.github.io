      <description>Athena flights I worked on this project with @Joseph Tran . This is a web app built with Next.js, React and Typescript on the front-end. We used Postgres for the database and Typeorm with Apollo Server and Graphql on the back-end. We queried SpaceX&amp;rsquo;s api, then added flight information to the launches so users can choose flights to book based on destination and departure dates. I worked on both the front-end and back-end functionality to filter flights, authenticate users, cancel bookings.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on getting this hugo blog up and running. I want to have a place where I can share my thoughts on projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping a google doc journal for myself but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s a hassle to have to go online to write it. I was thinking about moving my journal to markdown anyways so I might as well just host it online with hugo as well.</description>
