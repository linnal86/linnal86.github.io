      <description>Time really flies! It&amp;rsquo;s been six weeks since I&amp;rsquo;ve become a participant at the Recurse Center (RC). It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing space for new or experienced programmers, developers, or anyone who wants to spend time learning more about code. I&amp;rsquo;ve met so many motivated and talented individuals whom have inspired me to build more and code more frequently.
I signed up to participate from February 15th to May 7th or the &amp;ldquo;Spring 1 2021 batch&amp;rdquo; as we call it.</description>

      <description>Athena flights I worked on this project with @Joseph Tran . This is a web app built with Next.js, React and Typescript on the front-end. We used Postgres for the database and Typeorm with Apollo Server and Graphql on the back-end. We queried SpaceX&amp;rsquo;s api, then added flight information to the launches so users can choose flights to book based on destination and departure dates. I worked on both the front-end and back-end functionality to filter flights, authenticate users, cancel bookings.</description>
