[{"content":"Configure token authentication for git operations through GitHub GitHub has announced token authentication requirements for git operations . They will not support password authentication for git operations and will require using personal access tokens over HTTPS or SSH keys by August 13, 2021.\nThe recommendation is to use personal access tokens and it is explained in this youtube video about personal access tokens .\nSetting up personal access tokens You can generate the personal access token in GitHub by going into \u0026gt;Settings \u0026gt;Developer settings \u0026gt;Personal access tokens\nWhen you are prompted for your credentials during a git operation, use your personal access token instead of your password. Your personal access token will only be visible on GitHub the first time it\u0026rsquo;s generated, you will not be able to see it once you leave the page after you\u0026rsquo;ve generated it.\nYou might want to cache it on your computer so you don\u0026rsquo;t get prompted for your your email and password, or in this case your personal access token, each time. Type in the follow command in your git project directory to cache your login credentials:\n#need to type this before git asks for your login credentials usually during a push or pull request git config --global credential.helper cache Once you\u0026rsquo;ve initiated caching, start a pull or push request. For the password field, copy and paste in the token. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to type your credentials in the next time you push or pull. If for some reason your computer prompts for a username and password again you can just re-generate the token or create a new token. You can change your token at any time by re-generating or deleting and creating a new one.\nYou can create multiple personal access tokens and configure them with different permissions and use/associate them for different operations. I\u0026rsquo;ve only needed the repo permissions thus far but you have the option to enable others:\nCommands and files related to this topic that might be useful:\n# see the file the stores your git configurations: cat ~/.gitconfig # edit the file the stores your git configurations (can use either vim, nano or other terminal editors): vim ~/.gitconfig #sets your git profile's email address your user.email without going into .gitconfig git config --global user.email \u0026quot;example@email.com\u0026quot; #shows what your git profile's user.name and user.email variables are set to git config -l ##deletes the cache for your credentials git config --global --unset credential.helper Setting up SSH authentication If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a ssh key or you don\u0026rsquo;t know if you do follow the guide in Generating a new ssh key and adding it to the ssh agent .\nTo generate a ssh key for github use the following command and replace the example email with your GitHub email.\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \u0026quot;your_email@example.com\u0026quot; If you think you might have a ssh key, you can check the id_rsa.pub file (default location of ssh keys):\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Or just check the ssh directory to see what files there are\nls ~/.ssh Then follow the guide in Adding a new ssh key ot your github account to add the SSH key to your GitHub account.\n","permalink":"https://linnali.com/posts/configure_token_authentication_for_git_operations_through_github/","summary":"Configure token authentication for git operations through GitHub GitHub has announced token authentication requirements for git operations .

It\u0026rsquo;s been six weeks since I\u0026rsquo;ve become a participant at the Recurse Center (RC). It\u0026rsquo;s an amazing space for new or experienced programmers, developers, or anyone who wants to spend time learning more about code. I\u0026rsquo;ve met so many motivated and talented individuals whom have inspired me to build more and code more frequently.\nI signed up to participate from February 15th to May 7th or the \u0026ldquo;Spring 1 2021 batch\u0026rdquo; as we call it. The first couple week of RC was a bit overwhelming especially since everything is virtual at the moment and all of my interactions are via zoom and chat on RC\u0026rsquo;s zulip platform. I didn\u0026rsquo;t work on my personal projects for the first week but I did pair program on a game of life problem and did a few leetcode problems collaboratively with others RC members. This definitely opened up my perspective on how others program and also gave me reassurance that I\u0026rsquo;m learning the right things and adhering to good coding conventions. Most coding best practices are subjective and really depends on your use case.\nLearning more about Generative Art I learned more about generative art and now I\u0026rsquo;m really interested in trying to create my own works some day. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely going to learn more about p5.js. I was introduced to the works of Tyler Hobbs and really like how he tries to imitate the qualities of traditional mediums like watercolor. The colors he chooses are energetic but at the same time, calming. I would love to hang one up in my house in the future.\nChanging my website to Hugo blog I also got inspired to transform this website (linnali.com) from a html,css,javascript portfolio website to a hugo blog. I considered hugo prior to RC but I decided not to use it because it looked too plain but after seeing a fellow RC\u0026rsquo;er hugo blog I decided to convert. I liked the minimalism of it but you can add some customizations after you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with the theme structure. The important thing is that it\u0026rsquo;s a good place to start if you want to write blog posts and publish fast. I got caught up in designing my site a little more so it took longer. I watched Mike Dane\u0026rsquo;s Hugo Tutorial Series to get a basic understanding of how themes work and how to deploy. I will likely migrate this site to be a Next.js blog but for now hugo is a great template.\nAthena flights Next.js project For the past two weeks I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on Athena flights (you can find it on my Software Projects page.) It\u0026rsquo;s been a great learning experience. I was new to Next.js, Typescript, GraphQL, and Postgres so this project was a great way for me to start working with these technologies with another RC\u0026rsquo;er who has built another project with this tech stack. From this project I realized that having someone walk though a piece of code you\u0026rsquo;re working is immensely more helpful and speeds up your learning way more than just watching tutorials on the topic.\nRC is just a great place to learn from others even if they are on topics you\u0026rsquo;re not ever going to dig into. Just be careful to stay on track and prioritize your own personal goals before you get enticed down rabbit holes of other people\u0026rsquo;s passion projects. You can find people working in a variety of different programming languages (C, Haskell, Python, Javascript/Typescript, Java, Lisp, Rust, Scala, \u0026hellip;etc). There\u0026rsquo;s presentations every friday for those who want to share their work and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen amazing project from web apps and games to bots and a small scale database.\nIf this sounds like a group you\u0026rsquo;d like to be a part of you can apply at RC\u0026#39;s application page . It\u0026rsquo;s a great time. It\u0026rsquo;s completely free and since it\u0026rsquo;s all virtual you will not have to pay for NYC rent. Usually the program is held in-person and you\u0026rsquo;d have to either live or relocate to NYC but at the moment it is open to everyone around the world!\nI still have six more weeks in of my batch left and I will use this time to work on more coding project with my fellow RC members and learn more programming through zoom coffee chats and pair programming. But after my batch ends I\u0026rsquo;ll still keep learning and collaborate with others because our motto is to \u0026ldquo;Never Graduate\u0026rdquo;!\n","permalink":"https://linnali.com/posts/my-journey-as-a-participant-with-recurse-center-part-one-of-two/","summary":"Time really flies!

I want to have a place where I can share my thoughts on projects I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on. I\u0026rsquo;ve been keeping a google doc journal for myself but I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a hassle to have to go online to write it. I was thinking about moving my journal to markdown anyways so I might as well just host it online with hugo as well. I\u0026rsquo;ll try this for a bit and also keep my google doc journal and see which one I like better.\nThis has been a great resource: Markdown Guide I think the problem with writing this straight in a markdown file is that there isn\u0026rsquo;t a spellchecker. My spelling have been getting progressively worse since I\u0026rsquo;ve stopped writing book reports with pen and paper.\nSpell Checker in VSCode editor Actually I just found a the solution to the problem above. For context, I\u0026rsquo;m writing this in vscode on my computer and I found that there is a spellchecker extension called \u0026ldquo;Code Spell Checker\u0026rdquo; by Street Side Software after a quick search. It works great now! I think it only checks for spelling and not grammar\u0026hellip; but google docs and microsoft word doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a spectacular job at that anyways.\nFormatting text and emojis in VSCode with keyboard shortcuts Also apparently you can press \u0026raquo; ctrl + p and type \u0026raquo; \u0026gt;join lines to format the text (probably can also add this as a keyboard shortcut. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll use leave it for now). I found that you have to disable the \u0026ldquo;Prettier\u0026rdquo; extension with Hugo otherwise it will mess up the formatting of the code parts if you go and edit the themes. There\u0026rsquo;s probably a setting I can change to have it be compatible. I\u0026rsquo;ll look into that later. Also, you can press \u0026raquo; ctrl + i to get emojis: 😁. Theres also Shortcodes in Hugo for that\u0026hellip; I think\u0026hellip; but I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do that yet so this is a nice alternative.

I watched multiple youtube videos and read various blogs. I had to reference numerous different sources so here is a consolidated guide of how to do it.\nDigital Ocean Setup I hosted my server on digitalocean. The alternatives includes Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Siteground, Heroku, etc but I found that digitalocean was the easiest, most reliable and the cheapest in the long run.\nCreate Droplet on Digital Ocean Create a Digital Ocean account and then create a droplet. Choose the latest ubuntu image from Distrubutions, choose the plan and monthly rate that fits your needs. For toy apps or hobby projects you can just choose the basic plan and the cheapest monthly rate. You can always upgrade later.\nA droplet is a virtual private server (VPS).\nI DID NOT select mongodb from the marketplace. For some reason it works better for me if I manually install it on the droplet.\nChoose ubuntu, basic plan, and lowest monthly option You can choose either SSH keys or password. The password option is the fastest. Just create a password and that will be what you\u0026rsquo;ll use to login in when you ssh into the vps ubuntu linux distribution. You can change it to ssh later on Adding a domain to your application. if you want to get a SSL certificate from LetsEncrypt you will need a domain name. LetsEncrypt does not give certificates to raw ip address. You may be able to find other certificate providers who will give certificates for raw ips but I don\u0026rsquo;t know which ones\nOn digitalocean, on the sidebar go to \u0026gt; Networking Enter yourdomainname.com and add Add an A record for @ and www to your droplet.\n Add @ under HOSTNAME, select your droplet under WILL DIRECT TO and click Create Record Add www under HOSTNAME, select your droplet under WILL DIRECT TO and click Create Record  Go to domain registrar, (I use Namecheap), add the nameservers to the custom DNS section\nThis will take anywhere between 15 - 20 minutes to propogate. It may take longer. Check https://www.whatsmydns.net/ to see propgation status of your domain name.\nSSH into droplet and install mongodb, node, nginx and pm2 SSH into the vps ubuntu linux distribution by opening your terminal if your on mac or linux with the ip address generated by digitalocean. This can be found on the droplet next to the name of the droplet\nssh root@your-ip-address-from-digitalocean-next-to-droplet Enter y when terminal asks\nAre you sure you want to conitnue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\nThen it will ask you for your the root password you created in the Authentication section.\nNow you\u0026rsquo;re logged in.\nI installed mongodb manually and did not install it from the marketplace.\nsudo apt update sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install mongodb sudo systemctl status mongodb Install Node/NPM.
