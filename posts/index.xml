      <description>Software projects Athena flights  I worked on this project with @Joseph Tran . This is a web app built with Next.js, React and Typescript on the front-end. We used Postgres for the database and Typeorm with Apollo Server and Graphql on the back-end. We queried SpaceX&amp;rsquo;s api, then added flight information to the launches so users can choose flights to book based on destination and departure dates. I worked on both the front-end and back-end functionality to filter flights, authenticate users, cancel bookings.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on getting this hugo blog up and running. I want to have a place where I can share my thoughts on projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping a google doc journal for myself but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s a hassle to have to go online to write it. I was thinking about moving my journal to markdown anyways so I might as well just host it online with hugo as well.</description>

      <description>It took me 2 weeks to figure out how to deploy my fullstack nodejs react app. It uses the MERN stack - mongodb, express, react, and nodejs. I watched multiple youtube videos and read various blogs. I had to reference numerous different sources so here is a consolidated guide of how to do it.
Digital Ocean Setup  I hosted my server on digitalocean. The alternatives includes Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Siteground, Heroku, etc but I found that digitalocean was the easiest, most reliable and the cheapest in the long run.</description>
