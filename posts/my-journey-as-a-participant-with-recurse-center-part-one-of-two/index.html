  "articleBody": "Time really flies! It‚Äôs been six weeks since I‚Äôve become a participant at the Recurse Center (RC). It‚Äôs an amazing space for new or experienced programmers, developers, or anyone who wants to spend time learning more about code. I‚Äôve met so many motivated and talented individuals whom have inspired me to build more and code more frequently.\nI signed up to participate from February 15th to May 7th or the ‚ÄúSpring 1 2021 batch‚Äù as we call it. The first couple week of RC was a bit overwhelming especially since everything is virtual at the moment and all of my interactions are via zoom and chat on RC‚Äôs zulip platform. I didn‚Äôt work on my personal projects for the first week but I did pair program on a game of life problem and did a few leetcode problems collaboratively with others RC members. This definitely opened up my perspective on how others program and also gave me reassurance that I‚Äôm learning the right things and adhering to good coding conventions. Most coding best practices are subjective and really depends on your use case.\nLearning more about Generative Art I learned more about generative art and now I‚Äôm really interested in trying to create my own works some day. I‚Äôm definitely going to learn more about p5.js. I was introduced to the works of Tyler Hobbs and really like how he tries to imitate the qualities of traditional mediums like watercolor. The colors he chooses are energetic but at the same time, calming. I would love to hang one up in my house in the future.\nChanging my website to Hugo Blog I also got inspired to transform this website (linnali.com) from a html,css,javascript portfolio website to a hugo blog. I considered hugo prior to RC but I decided not to use it because it looked too plain but after seeing a fellow RC‚Äôer hugo blog I decided to convert. I liked the minimalism of it but you can add some customizations after you‚Äôre familiar with the theme structure. The important thing is that it‚Äôs a good place to start if you want to write blog posts and publish fast. I got caught up in designing my site a little more so it took longer. I watched Mike Dane‚Äôs Hugo Tutorial Series to get a basic understanding of how themes work and how to deploy. I will likely migrate this site to be a Next.js blog but for now hugo is a great template.\nAthena flights Next.js project For the past two weeks I‚Äôve been working on Athena flights (you can find it on my Software Projects page.) It‚Äôs been a great learning experience. I was new to Next.js, Typescript, GraphQL, and Postgres so this project was a great way for me to start working with these technologies with another RC‚Äôer who has built another project with this tech stack. From this project I realized that having someone walk though a piece of code you‚Äôre working is immensely more helpful and speeds up your learning way more than just watching tutorials on the topic.\nRC is just a great place to learn from others even if they are on topics you‚Äôre not ever going to dig into. Just be careful to stay on track and prioritize your own personal goals before you get enticed down rabbit holes of other people‚Äôs passion projects. You can find people working in a variety of different programming languages (C, Haskell, Python, Javascript/Typescript, Java, Lisp, Rust, Scala, ‚Ä¶etc). There‚Äôs presentations every friday for those who want to share their work and I‚Äôve seen amazing project from web apps and games to bots and a small scale database.\nIf this sounds like a group you‚Äôd like to be a part of you can apply at RC's application page . It‚Äôs a great time. It‚Äôs completely free and since it‚Äôs all virtual you will not have to pay for NYC rent. Usually the program is held in-person and you‚Äôd have to either live or relocate to NYC but at the moment it is open to everyone around the world!\nI still have six more weeks in of my batch left and I will use this time to work on more coding project with my fellow RC members and learn more programming through zoom coffee chats and pair programming. But after my batch ends I‚Äôll still keep learning and collaborate with others because our motto is to ‚ÄúNever Graduate‚Äù!\n",

<p>Time really flies!
It&rsquo;s been six weeks since I&rsquo;ve become a participant at the Recurse Center (RC).
It&rsquo;s an amazing space for new or experienced programmers, developers, or anyone who wants to
spend time learning more about code. I&rsquo;ve met so many motivated and talented individuals
whom have inspired me to build more and code more frequently.</p>
<p><img src="/my-journey-as-a-participant-with-recurse-center-part-one-of-two/recurse-center-office-space-new-york-city.jpg" alt="recurse center office space new york city"></p>
<p>I signed up to participate from February 15th to May 7th or the &ldquo;Spring 1 2021 batch&rdquo; as we call it.
The first couple week of RC was a bit overwhelming especially since everything is virtual at the moment and
all of my interactions are via zoom and chat on RC&rsquo;s zulip platform.
I didn&rsquo;t work on my personal projects for the first week but I did pair program on a game of life problem
and did a few leetcode problems collaboratively with others RC members. This definitely opened up
my perspective on how others program and also gave me reassurance that I&rsquo;m learning the right things and
adhering to good coding conventions. Most coding best practices are subjective and really depends on your use case.</p>

<p>I learned more about generative art and now I&rsquo;m really interested in trying to create my own works some day.
I&rsquo;m definitely going to learn more about p5.js.
I was introduced to the works of <a href="https://tylerxhobbs.com/work" target="_blank">Tyler Hobbs</a>
 and really like how he tries to
imitate the qualities of traditional mediums like watercolor. The colors he chooses are energetic but at the

<p>I also got inspired to transform this website (linnali.com) from a html,css,javascript portfolio website to a

I will likely migrate this site to be a Next.js blog but for now hugo is a great template.</p>

<p>For the past two weeks I&rsquo;ve been working on Athena flights (you can find it on my <a href="https://linnali.com/posts/software-projects/" target="_blank">Software Projects</a>

project was a great way for me to start working with these technologies with another RC&rsquo;er who has built another project with this

and speeds up your learning way more than just watching tutorials on the topic.</p>
<p><img src="/my-journey-as-a-participant-with-recurse-center-part-one-of-two/recurse-center-logo.png" alt="recurse center logo"></p>
<p>RC is just a great place to learn from others even if they are on topics you&rsquo;re not ever going to dig into. Just be
careful to stay on track and prioritize your own personal goals before you get enticed down rabbit holes of other
people&rsquo;s passion projects. You can find people working in a variety of different programming languages (C, Haskell, Python, Javascript/Typescript, Java, Lisp, Rust, Scala, &hellip;etc). There&rsquo;s presentations every friday for those who want to share their work
and I&rsquo;ve seen amazing project from web apps and games to bots and a small scale database.</p>
<p>If this sounds like a group you&rsquo;d like to be a part of you can apply at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply" target="_blank">RC&#39;s application page</a>
. It&rsquo;s
a great time. It&rsquo;s completely free and since it&rsquo;s all virtual you will not have to pay for NYC rent. Usually the program is held in-person
and you&rsquo;d have to either live or relocate to NYC but at the moment it is open to everyone around the world!</p>
<p>I still have six more weeks in of my batch left and I will use this time to work on more coding project with my fellow RC members and
