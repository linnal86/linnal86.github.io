[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m working on getting this hugo blog up and running. I want to have a place where I can share my thoughts on projects I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on. I\u0026rsquo;ve been keeping a google doc journal for myself but I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a hassle to have to go online to write it. I was thinking about moving my journal to markdown anyways so I might as well just host it online with hugo as well. I\u0026rsquo;ll try this for a bit and also keep my google doc journal and see which one I like better.\nI think the problem with writing this straight in a markdown file is that there isn\u0026rsquo;t a spellchecker. My spelling have been getting progressively worse since I\u0026rsquo;ve stopped writing book reports with pen and paper.\nSpell Checker in VSCode editor Actually I just found a the solution to the problem above. For context, I\u0026rsquo;m writing this in vscode on my computer and I found that there is a spellchecker extension called \u0026ldquo;Code Spell Checker\u0026rdquo; by Street Side Software after a quick search. It works great now! I think it only checks for spelling and not grammar\u0026hellip; but google docs and microsoft word doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a spectacular job at that anyways.\nFormatting text and emojis in VSCode with keyboard shortcuts Also apparently you can press \u0026raquo; ctrl + p and type \u0026raquo; \u0026gt;join lines to format the text (probably can also add this as a keyboard shortcut. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll use leave it for now). I found that you have to disable the \u0026ldquo;Prettier\u0026rdquo; extension with Hugo otherwise it will mess up the formatting of the code parts if you go and edit the themes. There\u0026rsquo;s probably a setting I can change to have it be compatible. I\u0026rsquo;ll look into that later. Also, you can press \u0026raquo; ctrl + i to get emojis: 😁. Theres also Shortcodes for that\u0026hellip; I think\u0026hellip; but I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do that yet so this is a nice alternative. I got my info from this stackoverflow page .\nOpen external links in new tab (target=\u0026rdquo;_blank\u0026rdquo;) with markdown in Hugo Add the following code to /layout/_default/_markup/render-link.html\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Destination | safeURL }}\u0026quot;{{ with .Title}} title=\u0026quot;{{ . }}\u0026quot;{{ end }}{{ if strings.HasPrefix .Destination \u0026quot;http\u0026quot; }} target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot;{{ end }}\u0026gt;{{ .Text }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; ","permalink":"https://linnali.com/posts/setting-up-my-hugo-blog/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m working on getting this hugo blog up and running.
